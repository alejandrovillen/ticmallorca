JBoss Web Services - Stack CXF
http://www.jboss.org/jbossws/

Version: jbossws-cxf-3.4.1.GA

Installation instructions
=========================

In order to install JBossWS the following steps are necessary:

1.) Copy ant.properties.examples to ant.properties
2.) Modify the target container location in ant.properties
3.) Execute

	ant deploy-jboss600

    By default the SOAP stack will be installed to 'default' configuration.
If users want to install SOAP stack to different JBossAS configuration then
they have to specify -Djboss.server.instance=foo JVM property.
Supported configurations of the installer are 'default', 'all' and 'standard'.

	ant -Djboss.server.instance=standard deploy-jboss600

    By default Spring Framework libraries are not installed to application
server. In order to do that, please add the -Dspring=true property option when
running the ant script:

        ant -Dspring=true deploy-jboss600

Please note Spring is required for advanced configuration only, whenever users
want to provide their own jbossws-cxf.xml Spring configuration file.

4.) Execute the samples to verify your installation

   'ant tests'

   You should see no errors.
